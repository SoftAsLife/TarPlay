# TarPlay
TarPlay allows you to mirror your mobile device's screen with audio to a browser or our receiver app, which runs on a car, a desktop, or other compatible devices. For example, you can view your phone within the browser window on Tesla.

With a decade-long emphasis on mobile streaming technologies, our team takes pride in being pioneers in implementing protocols like AirPlay, Chromecast, Miracast, CarPlay, and Android Auto. We provide both wireless and USB wired streaming solutions for Android, iOS and desktop.
